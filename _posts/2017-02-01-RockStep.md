excerpt: Microsoft teamed up with RockStep to deliver realtime IoT data to their labs through Power BI Embedded.

Microsoft joined RockStep to create a Power BI Embedded solution, which gives access IoT data analyses in realtime to reduce operating and maintenance costs for their clinical trial customers. Research facilities have thousands of housing units that need to be checked on a regular schedule to ensure the conditions are within compliance. RockStep is teaming up with the University of Michigan to run a pilot IoT program that monitors key environmental measurements in real time and will proactively alert technicians when conditions reach a threshold range. By reducing the number of visits to each unit they can cut maintenance and operating costs and improve the overall health of animals.

Customers will have access to the Power BI Embedded dashboards allowing them to make decisions based on these realtime data and improve the overall health of animals.

## Customer profile ##

[RockStep Solutions](https://www.rockstepsolutions.com) creates world-class scientific data management tools for research. Its innovative software system [Climb](https://www.rockstepsolutions.com/features/introducing-climb/) is designed to transform and modernize information management in a laboratory setting. The RockStep team's experience comes directly from years of working at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine. RockStep's goal is to create software that enables science by leveraging the team's experience working in research laboratories to build software that is easy to learn, usable anywhere, and truly valuable to research.

## Problem statement ##

RockStep will be deploying around 100 devices to pilot the IoT project, previously supported by James Sturtevant. These devices will be going into several different animal rooms and will continuously collect temperature, ammonia, humidity, noise and light levels. For the pilot, RockStep will only be analyzing these data, but in the future they will layer in experimental data so that the users can look at experimental results in the context of factors such as noise and light levels.  The first goal is to monitor environmental data for the purposes of more accurately determining cage change rates.  Cages must be changed at periodic intervals to keep the levels of ammonia and humidity within FDA regulation values, however cage changes are costly and disruptive to the animals.  So the IoT data will help the technicians in the facility to only change cages when necessary. 
We will be building PowerBI reports for users to view the streaming data from the IoT devices, do real time transformations on the data, do aggregations, create alerts, and store the data.  We are assuming that the stored data will be used for historical analysis as well.

Our goal was to connect to the RockStep data hosted in an Azure SQL Database and integrate the created Power BI reports into their current MClimb application.

## Key Technologies Used 
- [Power Bi Embedded](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/power-bi-embedded/) 
- [Power Bi Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) 
- [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/) 
- [ASP.NET MVC](https://www.asp.net/mvc) 
- [Angular 2.0](https://angular.io/)
- [Azure App Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/)

## Solutions, steps, and delivery ##
RockStep and Microsoft teamed up to create a "proof of concept" that would display their simulated IoT data through embedded Power BI reports in a website running Angular 2.0. The solution was developed over the course of a few days at a hackfest held at the Microsoft office in Burlington, Massachusetts.  

The overall architecture for their IoT Solution is as follows:

This solution is the base for the data that was passed into the Power BI Embedded Solution Architecture that is seen below:

1. [Connect to RockStep data in Azure Sql DBs](#1-connect-to-athena-data-in-postgresql-dbs-in-azure-iaas).
2. [Build a report using Power BI desktop](#2-create-a-report-in-power-bi-desktop).
3. [Deploy a report to Power BI Embedded in Azure and Upload Reports](#3-set-up-power-bi-embedded-workspace-in-microsoft-azure-and-upload-reports).
4. [Integrate PBIE reports into an ASP.NET MVC web application](#4-embed-report-into-existing-aspnet-mvc-application-and-authorize-users-for-specific-reports).

### 1. Connect to RockStep Data in Azure SQL DBs



### 2. Create a template report in Power BI Desktop


### 3. Set up Power BI Embedded workspace in Microsoft Azure and Upload Reports

There are several methods to publish a report in a Power BI Embedded workspace:
- Using the one provided in the sample app: [Sample app](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/power-bi-embedded-integrate-report-into-web-app/)
- Using the Power BI command line tool: [Power BI Command Line Tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-Cli)

We used the command line tool to publish our reports in the workspace. Below are steps and screenshots of the process:
- First we had to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Then we installed a Power BI node.js package using the command prompt: `npm install powerbi-cli -g`

![Install node.js package](/images/Athena/Nodejs-PowerBI.PNG)

- And finally, we used the command "powerbi - import" as listed in the screenshot below to add the Power BI Desktop reports to the Azure Workspace Collection:

### 4. Embed report into existing ASP.NET Web API and connect through Angular 2 application
The application builds off of the sample provided by the Power Bi embedded team found here: [Embed Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/power-bi-embedded-integrate-report-into-web-app)

We began by setting up a new PowerBIController within the existing web application.  Through this controller we are able to limit access to the RitterIM internal report.  In code, we create an embed token using:

`var embedToken = PowerBIToken.CreateReportEmbedToken(this.workspaceCollection, this.workspaceId, report.Id);` 

This allows us to view the embedded report within the existing website:

### Multi-Tenants in Power BI ###


### Visual studio nuget versioning ###
We ran into some issues with Visual Studio nugest versioning with the Microsoft Power BI SDK. We followed [this](https://microsoft.github.io/techcasestudies/power%20bi%20embedded/2016/11/21/surespot.html#general-lessons) guide from Microsoft's, Paul Decarlo, on what was necessary to get the SDK working and the app to run.
